Python implimentation of John Conway's Life

This was a project in response to an on-line python course. I wanted to: read and wrote data to files, use objects containing their own rules about how they behave, Implement the game of life because I read about it years ago and it's stuck with me. I also want to follow up be implementing this in other languages such as C++.
